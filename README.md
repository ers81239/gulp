4/2013 - esmith notes - I originally found this code here:  http://staff.washington.edu/corey/gulp/.  That code had this tagline:

Corey Satten 
Email -- corey @ u.washington.edu 
Web -- http://staff.washington.edu/corey/ 
Date -- Tue Mar 18 14:14:09 PDT 2008

And the page stated that the code was released on the Apache Public License v2.0

There are a few other repos that appear to be the same code.  I forked this one because it seemed to be owned by the most-active user of all users with a gulp repo on github.
